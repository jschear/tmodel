At a time like this, words are inadequate. The most eloquent tribute would be a reverent silence.\nYet, in this decisive hour, when world events are moving so rapidly, our silence might be misunderstood and might give comfort to our enemies.\nIn His infinite wisdom, Almighty God has seen fit to take from us a great man who loved, and was beloved by, all humanity.\nNo man could possibly fill the tremendous void left by the passing of that noble soul. No words can ease the aching hearts of untold millions of every race, creed and color.

Dated January 14, 1946 \n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\nA quarter century ago the Congress decided that it could no longer consider the financial programs of the various departments on a piecemeal basis. Instead it has called on the President to present a comprehensive Executive Budget. The Congress has shown its satisfaction with that method by extending the budget system and tightening its controls. The bigger and more complex the Federal Program, the more necessary it is for the Chief Executive to submit a single budget for action by the Congress.\nAt the same time, it is clear that the budgetary program and the general program of the Government are actually inseparable. The President bears the responsibility for recommending to the Congress a comprehensive set of proposals on all Government activities and their financing.
