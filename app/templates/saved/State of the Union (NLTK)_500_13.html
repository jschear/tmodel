TRUMAN\u0027S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS\n \nApril 16, 1945\n\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress:\nIt is with a heavy heart that I stand before you, my friends and colleagues, in the Congress of the United States.\nOnly yesterday, we laid to rest the mortal remains of our beloved President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. At a time like this, words are inadequate. The most eloquent tribute would be a reverent silence.\nYet, in this decisive hour, when world events are moving so rapidly, our silence might be misunderstood and might give comfort to our enemies.\nIn His infinite wisdom, Almighty God has seen fit to take from us a great man who loved, and was beloved by, all humanity.\nNo man could possibly fill the tremendous void left by the passing of that noble soul. No words can ease the aching hearts of untold millions of every race, creed and color.
