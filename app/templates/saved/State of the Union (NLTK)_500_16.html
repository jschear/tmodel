EISENHOWER\u0027S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION\n \nThe opening of this new year must arouse in us all grateful thanks to a kind Providence whose protection has been ever present and whose bounty has been manifold and abundant. The State of the Union today demonstrates what can be accomplished under God by a free people; by their vision, their understanding of national problems, their initiative, their self-reliance, their capacity for work--and by their willingness to sacrifice whenever sacrifice is needed.\nIn the past three years, responding to what our people want their Government to do, the Congress and the Executive have done much in building a stronger, better America. There has been broad progress in fostering the energies of our people, in providing greater opportunity for the satisfaction of their needs, and in fulfilling their demands for the strength and security of the Republic.\nOur country is at peace. Our security posture commands r...", "topics": [{"proportion": "0.00473217742382", "topic_num": "0"}, {"proportion": "0.00417911066866", "topic_num": "1"}, {"proportion": "0.162024362591", "topic_num": "2"}, {"proportion": "0.0151574857585", "topic_num": "3"}, {"proportion": "0.0610896797743", "topic_num": "4"}, {"proportion": "0.0596517062109", "topic_num": "5"}, {"proportion": "0.0170102593883", "topic_num": "6"}, {"proportion": "0.0211029533765", "topic_num": "7"}, {"proportion": "0.167803910182", "topic_num": "8"}, {"proportion": "0.0437786903379", "topic_num": "9"}, {"proportion": "0.00879721807422", "topic_num": "10"}, {"proportion": "0.210058210276", "topic_num": "11"}, {"proportion": "0.0297031414192", "topic_num": "12"}, {"proportion": "0.0317218350755", "topic_num": "13"}, {"proportion": "0.141394972623", "topic_num": "14"}, {"proportion": "0.0217942868204", "topic_num": "15"}]}, {"text": "PRESIDENT DWIGHT D.

In this 200th anniversary year of our Constitution, you and I stand on the shoulders of giants--men whose words and deeds put wind in the sails of freedom. \nHowever, we must always remember that our Constitution is to be celebrated not for being old, but for being young--young with the same energy, spirit, and promise that filled each eventful day in Philadelphia\u0027s State House. We will be guided tonight by their acts; and we will be guided forever by their words. \nNow, forgive me, but I can\u0027t resist sharing a story from those historic days.
